#+TITLE: Building and installing Communi-Sailfish

* Building on/Installing from the community OBS
  Communi can be build individually on the community OBS and is already done so.

  We build on the OBS using the OBS service tar_git as explained in
  the SailfishOS wiki under [[https://docs.sailfishos.org/Tools/Sailfish_SDK/Building_packages/#tar_git-packaging-structure][Building_packages/#tar_git-packaging-structure]].

** SailfishOS-Chum
   Communi is present in SailfishOS-Chum and can be installed from the chum repositories.

   Please read [[https://github.com/sailfishos-chum/main#users-guide=][SailfishOS-Chum/main#users-guide]] to do so.

   Communi is present in Chum two versions:

   - Chum :: Latest stable version (same as in Harbour)

   - Chum-testing :: Latest nightly version build from master (read [[./docs/chum.org]] for more information)

** (For-)Harbour
   Builds submitted for Harbour are also build on the community OBS.
   These builds can be found at [[https://build.sailfishos.org/package/show/home:Thaodan:forharbour:communi/communi-sailfish][home:Thaodan:forharbour:communi/communi-sailfish]].

* Building locally from source
** Prerequisites

 Before you can anything else you should first [[https://docs.sailfishos.org/Tools/Sailfish_SDK/Installation/][install]][fn:1] the Sailfish SDK (or Platform SDK) and have
 read the Sailfish Wiki about building [[https://docs.sailfishos.org/Tools/Sailfish_SDK/Building_packages][packages]][fn:2].


*** Python-CairoSVG

 To build the app need to have python-cairosvg available in your target.
 One source for that is for example [[https://github.com/sailfishos-chum/main][SailfishOS-CHUM]], to add it read the SailfishOS wiki
 under [[https://docs.sailfishos.org/Tools/Sailfish_SDK/Deploying_packages/#deploying-from-repository][Deploying_packages/#deploying-from-repository]].

** Building

 Building Communi-Sailish is not different to any Sailfish App.

 To build the app you just run sfkdk (Sailfish SDK):

 #+begin_src sh
 sfkdk build
 #+end_src

 Or mb2 (Platform SDK):

 #+begin_src sh
 mb2 build
 #+end_src


** Installing
