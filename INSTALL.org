#+TITLE: Building and installing Communi-Sailfish
* Prerequisites

Before you can anything else you should first [[https://docs.sailfishos.org/Tools/Sailfish_SDK/Installation/][install]][fn:1] the Sailfish SDK (or Platform SDK) and have
read the Sailfish Wiki about building [[https://docs.sailfishos.org/Tools/Sailfish_SDK/Building_packages][packages]][fn:2].


** Python-CairoSVG

To build the app need to have python-cairosvg available in your target.
One source for that is for example [[https://github.com/sailfishos-chum/main][SailfishOS-CHUM]], to add it read the SailfishOS wiki
under [[https://docs.sailfishos.org/Tools/Sailfish_SDK/Deploying_packages/#deploying-from-repository][Deploying_packages/#deploying-from-repository]].

* Building

Building Communi-Sailish is not different to any Sailfish App.

To build the app you just run sfkdk (Sailfish SDK):

#+begin_src sh
sfkdk build
#+end_src

Or mb2 (Platform SDK):

#+begin_src sh
mb2 build
#+end_src
